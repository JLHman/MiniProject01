 # INF601 - Advanced Programming in Python
 Jesse Heckman
Mini Project 1 
 
Python program to extract and display data about several stocks.  This project was completed for the INF 601 class at 
Fort Hays University.  The objectives of the assignment were as follows
## Objectives

- (5/5 points) Initial comments with your name, class and project at the top of your .py file.
- (5/5 points) Proper import of packages used.
- (20/20 points) Using an API of your choice (yfinance works), collect the closing price of 5 of your favorite stock tickers for the last 10 trading days.
- (10/10 points) Store this information in a list that you will convert to a ndarray in NumPy.
- (10/10 points) Plot these 5 graphs. Feel free to add as much information to the graphs as you like exploring the documentation for matplotlib. 
                    At minimum, it just needs to show 10 data points.
- (10/10 points) Save these graphs in a folder called charts as PNG files. Do not upload these to your project folder, the project should save these when it 
                    executes. You may want to add this folder to your .gitignore file.
- (10/10 points) There should be a minimum of 5 commits on your project, be sure to commit often!
- (10/10 points) I will be checking out the master branch of your project. Please be sure to include a requirements.txt file which contains all the packages 
                    that need installed. You can create this file with the output of pip freeze at the terminal prompt.
- (20/20 points) There should be a README.md file in your project that explains what your project is, how to install the pip requirements, 
                 and how to execute the program. Please use the GitHub flavor of Markdown.

## Install 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
This will install all of the modules that you will need for the program. 

**Special note!** If you chose to import the packages individually make sure to use matplotlib 3.5.3.

## Running the program
To run this program clicking the green code button `clone` the code and run in you're preferred python editor.
